### Introduction

*Colorful* is a plugin for the premiere IRC application on OS X: [Textual](http://codeux.com/textual), allowing users to customize UI colors that are normally hardcoded. For now, this means the colors associated with the server and member lists, as was possible in LimeChat and old versions of Textual.

### Installation

Build the extension in Xcode (it was written in version 5â€”no guarantees are made of backwards compatibility). Upon successful compilation, it should be placed in:

`~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application Support/Textual IRC/Extensions`

Restart Textual and the plugin is loaded. To verify, open the preferences panel for the plugin.

### Usage

There are no commands associated with this plugin. All configuration is done through its preference pane.

### Known Bugs

- Textual may crash on application quit
- Using the default colors in the server list cause painting oddities
